# Sirius-Gmod

This project was created 4 years ago and was worked on by me and a friend and was the first coding project we ever worked on together.
It hasnt been updated since we created it however so it is most likly that the memory addresses need updated but appart from that it should be still fully functional.

The project is a hack for a game called Garrys Mod and has only a few basic features.
